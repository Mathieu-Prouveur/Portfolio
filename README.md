# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio, here you'll find :

####GoBot 2015-2016

This is a six-month Java project whose goal is to create an interface to play go and implement a bot to play with.

####Robot 2016

This is the result of a one-week physical computing crash course in which I made with another student a robot from the actual wiring of the components to the Arduino and Processing code. Arduino as slave to command the robot and Proccesing as master and enabling the user to send command via a GUI to the robot.
